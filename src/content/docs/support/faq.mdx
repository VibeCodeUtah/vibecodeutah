## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: What is Vibe Coding?**

Vibe Coding is a development approach where you orchestrate AI tools to build software. Instead of writing every line manually, you direct AI assistants while maintaining creative control and decision-making authority.

**Q: Do I need to be an experienced developer?**

No! All skill levels are welcome. The hackathon is about learning and experimenting with AI-assisted development. Beginners often have fresh perspectives that lead to innovative solutions.

**Q: Can I participate solo or do I need a team?**

Both! You can compete individually or form a team of up to 4 people. All team members must be registered.

### Eligibility & Rules

**Q: Why is MIT License required?**

The MIT License requirement ensures transparency, enables knowledge sharing, and allows judges to properly evaluate submissions. Your code contributes to the open-source community.

**Q: Can I use code I wrote before the hackathon?**

No. Projects must be started fresh for this hackathon. You can use third-party libraries, packages, and boilerplates, but the core project code must be new.

**Q: What AI tools can I use?**

Any AI coding assistant! Popular options include:
- Cursor
- GitHub Copilot
- Claude
- ChatGPT
- Codeium
- Amazon Q Developer

Using AI is not just allowed — it's **required**!

### Vibe Sessions

**Q: What should I record in my Vibe Sessions?**

Show your development process authentically:
- Screen with your IDE/editor
- AI tool interactions and prompts
- Your voice explaining decisions
- Problem-solving and debugging

**Q: Do I need to edit my Vibe Session videos?**

No! We prefer authentic, unedited footage. Mistakes and debugging are part of the process.

**Q: Can I do all 3 Vibe Sessions in one day?**

We recommend spacing them across your development time to show the project's evolution. However, there's no strict requirement on timing.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What tech stack should I use?**

Use whatever you're comfortable with! There are no restrictions on programming languages, frameworks, or platforms.

**Q: Can I use paid AI services?**

Yes, you can use any AI tools (free or paid). Just document what you used in your README.

**Q: My project needs API keys — how do I handle that?**

Never commit API keys to your repository. Use environment variables and document the required keys in your README without exposing actual values.

### Submission

**Q: When is the deadline?**

Check the [Timeline section](/#timeline) on the main page for exact dates.

**Q: Can I update my submission after submitting?**

You can update your repository until the deadline. However, once judging begins, all submissions are final.

**Q: What if my project isn't finished?**

Submit anyway! Judges evaluate what you've built and your process. A working MVP is better than an incomplete ambitious project.
