## What is Vibe Coding?

<Aside type="tip" title="The Vibe Code Philosophy">
  Vibe Coding is about **orchestrating AI tools** to build software. You direct the vision, AI helps execute. It's not about memorizing syntax — it's about solving problems creatively.
</Aside>

In your Vibe Sessions, show us:
- How you prompt and interact with AI
- Your decision-making process
- How you debug and iterate
- Your creative problem-solving
