    <Card title="Screen Record Everything" icon={Video}>
      You must submit <strong>3 Vibe Sessions</strong> (20-30 mins each). Show us
      your screen, your AI tools, and talk through your logic. We want to see the
      human directing the machine.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Clean Git History" icon={Code}>
      No dumping pre-written code. We analyze commit history. We want to see
      organic growth over the 15 days. Use libraries, but build the core here.
    </Card>
    <Card title="AI is Mandatory" icon={Sparkles} highlight={true}>
      This isn't a test of syntax memorization. It's a test of orchestration.
      Use Cursor, Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot. Show us how you <strong>Vibe Code</strong
      >.
